# Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat programs as their data.
# It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.
# In some cases, this allows programmers to minimize the number of lines of code to express a solution, thus reducing the development time.
# It also allows programs greater flexibility to efficiently handle new situations without recompilation.

# Metaprogramming can be used to move computations from run-time to compile-time,
# to generate code using compile time computations, and to enable self-modifying code.
# The language in which the metaprogram is written is called the metalanguage.
# The language of the programs that are manipulated is called the attribute-oriented programming language.
# The ability of a programming language to be its own metalanguage is called reflection or "reflexivity".
# Reflection is a valuable language feature to facilitate metaprogramming.
